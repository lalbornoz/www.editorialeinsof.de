        I began studying physics, biology, and chemistry at the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso in Chile.
        After travelling across the Americas for a stretch of 4 years, I eventually reached Kiel, in Germany, on a certain autumn evening, the place where
        I learnt German and graduated with a degree in geology, after a stroll through the midst of mathematics and anthropology, at the University of Kiel.

        As the years went by, I got back in touch with my passion for languages, cultural history, painting, literary works, and esotericism. For around 30 years,
        I conducted tarot card readings in Sydney, Hamburg, London, Tenerife, Madrid, and Santiago de Chile and studied the Kabbalah in depth, as well as dedicating
        myself to the study of Hebrew, topped off with a discreet brushstroke of Arabic. Between tarot card readings and lectures given, I slowly began drawing my
        own conclusions, eventually (in 1995) embodied in 77 hand-drawn cards and crafted along the lines of a mixture of the Kabbalah, personal experiences, and a
        hint of inspiration. “The cards of the heart” is the result and the name of the deck, along with an illustrated, bilingual book, of about 90 pages.

        I have often asked myself whether my cards and the accompanying book should allow me to bestow upon the jungle of esotericism a certain measure of clarity
        or whether I but added yet another “tree” to the dark forest of inspiration and the transcendental forces of constitution. I’ve also asked myself whether
        there may yet exist another possibility, by the guidance of which the spiritual confusion of our age may be abandoned.<br />
        <br />
        “Modern” man has become a wanderer in search of his spiritual roots long lost. He may move about copiously across the “geography” of a world gradually
        growing ever more monotonous, but his true yearnings concern the unexplored, geographic corners of his own soul.<br />
        <br />
        The “modern” world would seem to have opened many a hidden doors. Thereby, “new” impressions, at first, were procured. The colourful and confusing pluralism
        yet allows to perceive the clear and transparent background beneath it. The quality of the abundance of information, on the other hand, leaves much to be
        desired and as we all, consciously or subconsciously, dive and swim in the turbulent sea of the zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, we grow needful, more than
        ever before, of spiritual support, which may deliver to us the sober attitude of a new, higher form of consciousness attained.

        As in the preceding century, we hardly suffer from lack of information, the exact opposite is indeed the truth. Nevertheless, awareness, instant and immediate,
        scarcely follows. The demand for an all-encompassing system is greater than ever before, such that no formative developments ought be expected from this inundation
        in the sea of information, much more so the danger to lose sight of the big picture, and the outcomes as well as conclusions much promised and expected are exposed
        as but illusions, wishful thinking, and phantom images.
