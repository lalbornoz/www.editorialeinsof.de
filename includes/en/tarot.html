      What are the outermost and the utmost realities?<br />
      They meet within the hallowed twists and turns of the heart<br />
      leaving not the slightest trace and illuminate it for time eternal&semi;<br />
      They join in the unfathomable kiss of love<br />
      to thence depart and abandon<br />
      and to vanish like a breeze in twilight…<br />
      as night turns day and day turns night.

      The cards of the heart allow you to look upon the forces at work in any given moment and divine which decision should prove ideal.
      Furthermore, they assist whomever seeks their advice in understanding the past, and hence, conceiving the future.<br />
      These cards are based on the teachings of the Kabbalah, the foundation of the most eminent esoteric traditions in the Occident.
      Likewise, they admit the wisdom of Ancient Egypt, Pre-Columbian America, and more generally, antiquity, pure and imperishable gold.

      I have named them “The Cards of the Heart” for it is the place wherein which knowledge lingers within the grasp of our human condition.
      A proposition difficult to accept, perhaps, though certainly impossible where it conceived of as but the product and plaything of the
      mind, devoid of the slightest impact. That is to say, the heart would thus be pure, only if and after it empties itself of all that which
      is contrary and foreign to its true nature. Subsequently, it becomes an unfathomably vast recipient, which gracefully encompasses the timeless
      and eternal, and knows not demise. Apart from being free of corrosion, it summarises the unimaginable.<br />
      <br />
      At the heart of it, and in an imperceptible blink of time, knowledge turns into a vehicle towards eternity and life, in its expression
      most extensive, in exceptional liberty. Crucial it is not to know, but to live in accordance with what is known.

      It goes without saying that I do not assert claims of originality nor do I expect a medal, for many a nights I have burnt the midnight oil
      reading and studying, and I have devoured libraries like a starving lion devours gazelles. That said, I have, on my part, persevered in the
      objective of rendering intelligible the ideas contained herein and facilitate their perusal. The esteemed reader, on the verge of breaking
      free from the invisible corset which his culture has imposed on him, may feel confident to here discover the assistance sought much longed for.

      Its study, that is to say, due consideration, never exacts strict adherence of demanding doctrines, envious of all its kin, which lend their
      love unto solely themselves. Nor do I harbour dreams of disseminating and catechising orthodoxy of the religious sort, or political, philosophical,
      or of whichever kind it may be. Indeed, whether they be modern, of antiquity, or simply obsolete, that is to say, orthodoxy which wields sophistry
      (“we must veil our  treasure of treasures”) to the end of remaining in power and affording you an inkling of security, the object of your soul’s
      dreams, the sole purpose of which is to enslave your spirit, are neither considered nor addressed here.<br />
      <br />
      On the contrary! If I have but a dream, hoped for day and night, it is complete liberation. That these cards may assist whomever aspires to
      truly embrace humanity and the universe, and extend the hands infinite towards the stars. For those pure of heart, or those whom intend to attain
      it, they offer a stimulus, direction, suggestions estranged from ideology, far away from potential commercialisation, devoid of a specific purpose
      intended and the gilded lustre of mere appearance, as well as material ambitions.

      Perhaps it is at its best in tearing down barriers, fictitious and strange walls, which only ever existed within the minds of those whom, readily
      harbouring such supposed treasures, aspiring to gain entrance into the depths of life, categorising the conceivable and the inconceivable. Thus
      they proceed without considering that those very categories in their eminence are, at best, subterranean dungeons, radiant and vibrant on the outside,
      more so, grey edifices concealing horror, created for whomever considers solely power as their sole way of life.
