      The cards of the heart allow you to look upon the forces at work in any given moment and divine which decision should prove ideal.
      Furthermore, they assist whomever seeks their advice in understanding the past, and hence, conceiving the future.<br />
      These cards are based on the teachings of the Kabbalah, the foundation of the most eminent esoteric traditions in the Occident.
      Likewise, they admit the wisdom of Ancient Egypt, Pre-Columbian America, and more generally, antiquity, pure and imperishable gold.

      I have named them “The Cards of the Heart” for it is the place wherein which knowledge lingers within the grasp of our human condition.
      A proposition difficult to accept, perhaps, though certainly impossible were it conceived of as but the product and plaything of the
      mind, devoid of the slightest impact. That is to say, the heart would thus be pure, only if and after it empties itself of all that which
      is contrary and foreign to its true nature. Subsequently, it becomes an unfathomably vast recipient, which gracefully encompasses the timeless
      and eternal, and knows not demise. Apart from being free of corrosion, it summarises the unimaginable.

    <p style="font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify" id="content_tarot">
      At its heart, and in an imperceptible blink of time, knowledge turns into a vehicle towards eternity and life, in its expression
      most extensive, in exceptional liberty. Crucial it is not to know, but to live in accordance with what is known.

      It goes without saying that I do not assert claims of originality nor do I expect a medal, for many a nights I have burnt the midnight oil
      reading and studying, and I have devoured libraries like a starving lion devours gazelles. That said, I have, on my part, persevered in the
      objective of rendering intelligible the ideas contained herein and facilitate their perusal. The esteemed reader, on the verge of breaking
      free from the invisible corset which his culture has imposed on him, may feel confident to here discover the assistance sought much longed for.

      Its study, that is to say, due consideration, never exacts strict adherence to demanding doctrines, envious of all their kin, which lend their
      love unto solely themselves. Nor do I harbour dreams of disseminating and catechising orthodoxy of the religious sort, or political, philosophical,
      or of whichever kind it may be. Indeed, whether it be modern, of antiquity, or simply obsolete, that is to say, orthodoxy which wields sophistry
      (“we must veil our  treasure of treasures”) to the end of remaining in power and affording you an inkling of security, the object of your soul’s
      dreams, the sole purpose of which is to enslave your spirit, is neither considered nor addressed here.<br />

      On the contrary! If I have but a dream, cherished day and night, it is complete liberation. That these cards may assist whomever aspires to truly
      embrace humanity and the universe, and extend the hands infinite towards the stars. For those pure of heart, or those whom intend to attain it,
      they offer a stimulus, direction, suggestions estranged from ideology, far away from potential commercialisation, devoid of a specific purpose
      intended and the gilded lustre of mere appearance, as well as material ambitions.

      Perhaps it is at its best in tearing down barriers, fictitious and strange walls, which only ever existed within the minds of those whom, readily
      harbouring such supposed treasures, aspire to gain entrance into the depths of life by categorising the conceivable and the inconceivable. Thus
      they proceed without considering that those very categories in their eminence are, at best, subterranean dungeons, radiant and vibrant on the outside,
      more so, grey edifices concealing horror, created for whomever considers solely power as the sole way of life.

      The system consists of 77 cards, in addition to a black and a white card. You might have asked yourself: “For what reason? How do you arrive at this figure?”
      The answer is found in its original name, that is to say, the “Sistema Oz.” It is as obvious as clear and as easily understood. Let’s go step by step.<br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify" id="content_tarot">
      The Hebrew word [ʕoz] (עֹז), generally pronounced /oz/, the numeric value of which is 77<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, is the key. In order for this
      to make sense, it must first be understood that the letters of Hebrew, as well as other Semitic languages, are numbers also. The letter ע (ʕayin, inter alia eye,
      well) stands for 70 and ז (zayin, inter alia weapon, sustenance) stands for 7. Should this not suffice, consider the etymology of the word [ʕoz] (עֹז): might, with
      all one’s strength, power, praise, God’s strength and power<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, etc.

        1. The number 77 is truly unique. Apart from reminding me of the various meanings of [ʕoz] (עֹז), it admits several associations with Tarot. The major arcanum VI, “The lovers,”
        and XV, “The devil,” are parts of this purely esoterical statement. As the Hebrew letter ז (zayin) is associated with VI and ע (ʕayin) with XV, the correspondence grows
        large indeed. Elucidating it in all of its depth would demand much time and space and it would detract from the matter at hand. Last but not least, the number 77, by containing
        twice 7, embodies, better than any other, the deepest depths of esotericism. And on account of containing 11, it specifies the preordained number of magic permutations or the
        entrances and the points of departure (the sefirōt) through which God unfathomable (the emptiness or Nirvana) manifests himself.
